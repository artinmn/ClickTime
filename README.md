Test answer

Question 3:
Perfect Timing
Create two web-based stopwatches (one counting up and the other counting down), in a single web page written using JavaScript. You may use any JavaScript library you like, but please don't use any pre-written plugin that implements a clock or stopwatch.
Your solution should include:
•	1 input field: in which the user can specify how many seconds to count up to / down from. (We'll call this the countTarget from now on.)
•	2 read-only stopwatch displays: one counting up from 0 to countTarget, and the other counting down from countTarget to 0.
•	2 sets of stopwatch controls: one set of controls (start/pause button and reset button) for each stopwatch.
Other Requirements:
•	When the user enters a number into the input field, it resets one stopwatch to 0 and the other to countTarget.
•	The stopwatches always display in days, hours, minutes, and seconds (i.e. "3 days 1 hour 2 minutes 12 seconds").
•	Each stopwatch obeys its own start/pause button and reset button.
•	When a stopwatch reaches its target (either 0 or countTarget depending on which direction they are counting), the stopwatch stops counting and the start/pause button becomes disabled.
Evaluation
We will be evaluating your solution based on how well it adheres to the requirements set forth in this specification, how sensible your design choices are, and how efficient/clean/readable your code is.

In addition to your solutions, if you have a github, bitbucket, or other public repository, feel free to send us a link. Anything from a class project, to a weekend hack, to a complete app is a great way to give us a better picture of your overall skill set. If you don't have anything like this - don't worry! It's completely optional and you won't be docked points for only submitting the solutions.
Good Luck!
